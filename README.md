## Overview

This application automates the testing of a login functionality on a practice website using Selenium WebDriver. It generates an HTML report using Extent Reports, which logs test steps, results, and screenshots in case of failures.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version compatible with your project)
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (version compatible with your installed Chrome browser)
- [AventStack.ExtentReports](https://github.com/extent-framework/extentreports-dotnet) NuGet package

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-name

    Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

    Install the required NuGet packages:

    bash

    dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver
    dotnet add package Selenium.Chrome.WebDriver
    dotnet add package AventStack.ExtentReports

Usage

    Update the paths in the ExtentReport class as needed. Ensure the directories for report results and screenshots exist, or the application will create them.

    Run the project. The test will navigate to the practice login page, perform the login action, and generate a report in the specified directory.

    Open the generated HTML report to view the test results.
